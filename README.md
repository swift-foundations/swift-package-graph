# swift-package-graph

Package-level dependency graph queries for local SwiftPM workspaces.

Given a directory containing one or more SwiftPM packages, `swift-package-graph` discovers them, loads their manifests via `swift package dump-package`, and builds a typed dependency graph. Consumers query the graph for forward dependencies, reverse dependents, transitive closures, topological order, cycles, strongly connected components, or GraphViz visualization.

The library lives at `Package Graph`; the executable `package-graph` provides the queries from the command line.

## Library use

```swift
import Package_Graph

let workspace = try await Package.Workspace.discover(at: workspaceRoot)
let graph = try Package.Graph(workspace)

// What depends on swift-buffer?
let dependents = graph.directDependents(of: "swift-buffer")

// What's the full transitive closure?
let transitive = graph.transitiveDependents(of: "swift-buffer", depth: .max)
```

## CLI use

```sh
# From a workspace root:
package-graph dependents-of swift-buffer --depth 2
package-graph dependencies-of swift-array
package-graph topo
package-graph cycles
package-graph dot -o ecosystem.dot
```

## Architecture

L4 Composition. Depends on:

- L2: `swift-graph` (Graph.Sequential + traversal algorithms), `swift-path`, `swift-time`.
- L3: `swift-spm-standard` (SwiftPM `Package.Manifest` + `Package.Dependency` types).
- L4: `swift-process` (spawn `swift package dump-package`), `swift-file-system` (walk workspace), `swift-json` (decode manifest output), `swift-async` (concurrent loading), `swift-console` (CLI output).

See the [full design rationale](https://github.com/swift-institute/Research/blob/main/Packages/swift-package-graph/design.md) and the parent research doc [downstream-impact-ci-for-swiftpm-ecosystems.md](https://github.com/swift-institute/Research/blob/main/downstream-impact-ci-for-swiftpm-ecosystems.md) for the use case context.
